## This project consists of several modules. First is the Vocal Emotion Detection module which analyzes the user's emotion and passes the user input to the router agent whose job is to make a decision on which sub-agent this question is suited to. There is a RAG and Memory module which serves as the AI's knowledge-base. Thanks to the multimodal abilities of gemma3n, vision and audio input, coupled with agentic capabilities and long-term memory, births an abundance of possibilities.
